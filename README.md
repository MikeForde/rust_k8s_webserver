# OpenShift

devcontainer (incl. Dockerfile) + Dockerfile (for OpenShift) adjusted such that it can be deployed with pre-compiled binary as an experiment in reducing compile time on OS.

# Mac M1
devcontainer option included so will run in QEMU mode on Mac
This seems slower than running Ubuntu in UTM (on Mac)
Fatest naturally is running devcontainer on native Linux (and presumably PC but not tried as yet)
